ÿÓI made this program to show how 
anyone could make a fighting game 
using the loading of DC's and BitBlt 
and other things that can be foudn 
in the program.  I started making this 
just to test my vbskills and found that 
it was a lot easier than it may seem.  
Another thing about this is that this 
had one of the CRAPPIEST AI's 
ever written and should be deleted 
ASAP, but thats' up to you.  I'm sure 
anyone else could make a better AI, 
hell, I could've if I wasn't just doing 
this for an example.  Anyways, I hope 
that this helps those who want to 
lean how to do this sort of 
programming in Visual Basic.  Please 
email me with any questions or your 
own updates.   Thank you!
